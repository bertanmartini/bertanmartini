- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bertanmartini
I interested in the elements on the football pitch (ball, players, goal, field, etc.) tell us. 
Here to take my place in this data universe.
I am a football-lover who wants to have knowledge and experience in football analytics.
Football is random, I don't ignore it or I don't want to bore you with numbers0.
Analytics are just a tool and I'm looking for ways to make the best use of this tool.
